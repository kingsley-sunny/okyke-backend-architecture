# Okyke Security Architecture

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Okyke security architecture.

## System Components

The system is organized into several interconnected modules, each responsible for specific functionalities:

### Middlewares

The Middlewares provide implements first hand securities measures to all requests:

#### Rate Limiter Module

- **Rate Limiter Service**: Manages the rates at which request are being sent.
- **Rate Limiter Adapter**: Packages used for the rate limiter includes in-built too.

#### Cors Module

- **Cors Service**: Reject requests that are not from the Original application
- **Cors Adapter**: e.g: node-cors, cors e.t.c

### Input validation module

This validation module validates the request queries, params, or body

#### Request Validator Module

- **Request Validator Service**: Validates the request body, queries or params where being applied.
- **Request Validator Adapter**: Packages used for the validation of the requests details e.g, vinejs, zod.

#### File Validator Module**:

- **File Validator Service**: Validates the files that are being sent with the request
- **File Validator Adapter**: multer,cloudinary e.t.c



### Authentication and Authorization module

This validation module validates the who can have access and what they need to access. 

#### Authentication Adapters

- **Passport.js**: External framework for authorization.
- **Oauth2**: External package for handle authentication from other external applications.
- **Bycrpt.js**: External framework for hashing.

#### Authorization Adapters**:

- **Passport.js**: Adapter to handle authorization based on the passport framework.


### Logging and Monitoring module

This Module manages logging and Monitoring.

#### Logging and Monitoring Service

- **Adonis Logger Adapter**: External package for logging.
- **Sentry Adapter**: Adapter built on the external package (Sentry) for Monitoring.




### Schema Validator module

This Module validates the data before being stored in the database.

#### Schema Validator Adapter

- **Ajv Validator Adapter**: External package for validation database schemas.
- **Lucid Validator**: In-built package for validating database schemas.





## System Integrations

The architecture includes several key integrations between modules:

- The Middleware guards is the first guards and its intercepts and validates all requests.
- The inputs validation module validates each data that is being sent to the request to prevent attackers from inserting malicious data
- The Authentication validation Module integrates with the input validation module for proper validation
- The logging and Monitoring Module integrates with the all the module for proper monitoring.



## Design Principles

The system architecture follows these key design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a specific responsibility
2. **Scalability**: The system can handle growing numbers of users and transactions
3. **Security**: Multiple layers of security protect sensitive data
4. **Flexibility**: The system can adapt to different business models and requirements
5. **Integration**: Components work together seamlessly while maintaining separation of concerns

## Technical Implementation

The system is implemented using modern technologies and follows best practices:

- Module based architecture for scalability and maintainability
- RESTful APIs for communication between services
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

This security architecture provides a robust framework for an e-commerce system, enabling it to adapt to evolving business needs while ensuring high levels of security, performance, and reliability.
